 * 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/#/description
 *
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

 You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

 You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
